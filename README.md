## Work In Progress

I'm currently working on making this a multiplayer game that resets every 60 seconds. The idea is to answer as many math questions as possible with in 60s.

## Tech Package Usage

Using react, react-create-app, firebase realtime database and an animated counter I found that uses hammerjs (@nathanielw's https://codepen.io/nw/pen/zvQVWM).

## Help Wanted

- The basics of the game are there now but there's still a lot of work to be done. Please see the issues list for the current status of what needs to be done.

- Unlimited questions (currently only 10 questions are displayed)
- Addition of division questions
- Mobile compatibility
- Component testing
- Various UI improvements (Score layout, timer animation, correct/incorrect animation, color scheme, question answering delay)
- Chat capability
- Ability to set username
- 60s score reset but also add the overall session score

## Contribute

Please contribute to the project, including this README.
